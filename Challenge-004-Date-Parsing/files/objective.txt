A dataset contains a text field that has a date embedded within the text. The problem is that the date is represented a few different ways. For example:

•   16-APR-2005
•   Nov•16,•1900
•   4-SEP-00
•   Jan•5•2000

The goal is to create a new Date/Time field populated with the dates contained within the text field. You will also need to standardize the dates so that they are all formatted the same.
